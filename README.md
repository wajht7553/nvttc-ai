### Quick Start

1) Install Python (3.9+ recommended) and Jupyter
```bash
pip install notebook jupyterlab
```

2) Open the repository
- Windows: Open the folder in VS Code or run `jupyter lab`/`jupyter notebook` from the repo root.

3) Launch notebooks
- Navigate to any `Week XX/Notebooks` directory and open a `.ipynb` file.

4) Optional: Use VS Code
- Install the "Python" and "Jupyter" extensions
- Open this folder and run cells inline

If you see missing packages inside notebooks, install as needed, e.g.:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### Suggested Learning Path
1) Week 01: Refresh Python basics, data structures, control flow
2) Week 02: Master functions and OOP patterns used in ML codebases
3) Week 03: Build statistical intuition essential for ML modeling
4) Week 04: Get fluent with NumPy for efficient numeric computing


### Tips for Success
- Run cells frequently; experiment with parameters and visualize outputs
- Keep a notes notebook to summarize key takeaways each day
- Re-implement small utilities from memory (e.g., mean, variance, min-max scaling)
- Try converting pure-Python loops into vectorized NumPy operations

---

### Contributing
- Fork or create a new branch for additions
- Follow clear naming for notebooks and keep folders organized by week/topic
- Prefer small, focused edits with a short description
